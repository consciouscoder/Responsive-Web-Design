Responsive Web Design

Mobile First Development
    Designing a site for mobile FIRST
        - NOT worring about the desktop initially
        - Often a simpler design
        
    As our screen sizes get larger we can add more UI components / features and chane the layout
        - Progressive enhancement
            Avoid a waatered-down mobile experience
            
        - vs. Graceful Degradation
            As screen gets smaller - start ripping things out of the site
            

CSS
    Units
        Px          - least flexible
        vw / vh     - view width / view height
        em / rem    - refer to the width of the 'm' character
                        - ems look to the parent container and apply a coefficient to the sizes
                        - rems look to the font-size on the html tag (default font size)
        %           - refer to parent container OR body
        
    Media Queries
        -   Applying different styles based on screen size
        -   selectors and rulesets
        
    Specificity
        How important a style is and whether or not it should override / be overridden by other styles
        
        The more specific a selector is, the harder it is to override (cannot override an inline style)
            
        File order matters! If 2 selectors carry the same specificity, the one LOWER in the file
            
        Determined by the selector
                    ID      Classes         Tags
#myDiv              1       0               0           => 1 0 0
span.header-text    0       1               1           => 0 1 1
div span.myText     0       1               2           => 0 1 2
div span h1 marquee 0       0               4           => 0 0 4
